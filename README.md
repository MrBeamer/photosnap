## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

### Expected Behaviour

The following points are to clarify behaviour for areas where you might not be sure what's expected.

#### Multiple Pages

- The "Get an invite" call-to-action throughout the site should be an anchor tag, but doesn't link anywhere. If this was a real website, this could link to a sign up or application form.

#### Stories

- If this were a real site, each item on this page would be clickable and could link off to each of these stories in their own sites. So each item should be wrapped with an anchor tag, but it won't link anywhere on this project.

#### Pricing

- The "Pick a plan" call-to-actions in the pricing tiers should be anchor tags, but they don't link anywhere. If this was a real website, this could link to a checkout form.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. We provide both Sketch and Figma versions of the design, so you can choose which tool you prefer to use. You can download the design file on the platform. **Please be sure not to share them with anyone else.** The design download comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.
